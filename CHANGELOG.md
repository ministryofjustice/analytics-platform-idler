## [v0.5.2] - 2019-02-18
### Fixed
Updating `Service` correctly.

`Service` redirection needs to set `targetPort`.


## [v0.5.1] - 2019-02-18
### Fixed
Updating `Service` correctly.

There was a mistake in the code which redirected a Kubernetes `Service` to
the Unidler.


## [v0.5.0] - 2019-01-24
### Improvement
Redirect `Service` instead of `Ingress`.

Idling was achieved by disabling the app `Ingress` and adding the app hostname
to the unidler `Ingress`. If multiple users unidled at the same time, there
could be a race condition when removing the hostnames from the unidler `Ingress`.

This change does away with editing ingresses altogether and edits only the app
service. By changing the `Service` to what is essentially a `CNAME` forwarding to
the unidler, requests to the app host are handled by the unidler.


## [v0.4.0] - 2018-10-10

Lookup `Ingress` by App label.

For jupyter-lab support.
